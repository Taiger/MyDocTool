ASP3 Styleguide and Documentation website
==========

This site is powered by Codeignitor 2.2. I uses a number of components borrowed from the Styleguide Biolerplate.

Features:

    login/logout
    create/edit/delete Docs across two categories.
    create/edit/delete Patterns across five categories.
    WYSIWYG customized for Bootstrap powered by CKeditor.
    HTML for Patterns editable with the Ace editor.
    Basic page caching for extra speedy pages
    Styling is namespaced to seperate from it from the Less files.
    Less is processed to Css using Grunt
