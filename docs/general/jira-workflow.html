<h1>Jira Workflow</h1>

<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
 <li><strong>MAINTAINING ORGANIZATION IN THE BACKLOG</strong>-It&#39;s important that only I triage the tickets since there is a specific way that they are being categorized and staged for development.<br />
 &nbsp;</li>
 <li><strong>HOW TO LOG A TICKET</strong>-There are three methods for logging a ticket:
 <ol>
  <li>HipChat me with the slug TICKET: and then explain the ticket</li>
  <li>Email me with the slug &quot;TICKET:Explanation of ticket&quot; in the subject line</li>
  <li>Create a ticket in JIRA and do only three things:
  <ol>
   <li>populate Summary field</li>
   <li>populate Description field</li>
   <li>assign ticket to me. NOTE: If you assign the ticket to someone else or leave it unassigned it will get lost in the backlog. Also please do not tag the ticket with components or labels or any other metadata. I will take care of all of that.<br />

 <li><strong>DEV WORKFLOW IN BACKLOG</strong>-The dev workflow is simple too. We have four statuses in our workflow:
 <ol>
  <li>TO DO</li>
  <li>IN PROGRESS</li>
  <li>VERIFY</li>
  <li>DONE</li>
 </ol>
 </li>
</ol>

<em>We will be working in sprints, assigning tickets for a defined amount of time. We will have sprint kickoffs where we will commit to our tickets and work together to complete them all by the sprint end date.</em></p>

<p><em>Beyond that the dev workflow will remain the same. We will assign tickets to the person responsible for completing them. When that person has work for review they will assign to Mark to check (if necessary) and then Mark will assign to me. I will QA and depending on the nature of the task either release to QA team for further testing or approve to go live.</em></p>
