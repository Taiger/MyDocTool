<h1>Drupal Theme Documentation</h1>

<p><em>Living documentation for the platform theme, AF1, and site-specific themes such as ASP3</em></p>

<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To process all less files in both the platform and site-specific themes, add this as an alias:</p>

<pre>
alias makecss = &quot;pushd sites/all/themes/af1; grunt;cd ../asp3;grunt;echo &#39;done.&#39;;popd;&quot;</pre>

<h2>Annenberg Foundation v1 - AF1</h2>

<p><em>Platform Theme</em></p>

<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Structure of Less/Css</h3>

<p>Style.less contains all of the less files, including the Bootstrap library. Overrides.less is copied directly from the current starterkit for the official Drupal Bootstrap theme.<br />
<br />

<h2>Annenberg Space for Photography v3 - ASP3</h2>

<p><em>Site Theme for the Annenberg Space for Photography</em></p>

<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Structure of Less/Css</h3>

<p>Style.less contains all of the less files, including the Bootstrap library. The platform less files from AF1 are also included. This is preferable as they can be processed together.</p>
