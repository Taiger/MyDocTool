<h1>Component Naming</h1>

<p><em>A hybrid approach</em></p>

<p>Components are composed of Atoms (html elements) and sometimes Molecules (fields). Multiple Components are put together to form Templates. Templates are assigned to Pages.</p>

<h2>Component Class Names</h2>

<p>Components should be written in Capitol Casing or UpperCamelCase. This is to differentiate them from Drupal classes and Bootstrap classes, which both use dashes and lowercase.</p>

<pre>
ImageHero
VideoHero
CarouselHero
</pre>

<h2>Component Parts</h2>

<p>Each component part, is named using double dashes extended from the base component. Component Parts are totally optional, as they don&#39;t always make sense. Note that is this is mot Molecules or Atoms, as they are always reusable.</p>

<pre>
ImageHero--head
ImageHero--content
ImageHero--footer</pre>

<h2>Component Modifiers</h2>

<p>A variation of Component is named by extending the base Component name with double underscores.</p>

<pre>
ImageHero__special
ImageHero__secondary
ImageHero__secondary--head</pre>

<h2>Example</h2>
